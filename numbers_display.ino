/**
 * Helper function to print a given digit on a specific lcd screen.
 *
 * The value for "shift" is controlled by callers, and is used to "skip" pixels.
 * The higher the value of shift, the more pixels are skipped, with this you can make it appear to fade in and out
 *
 * For example shift value '2' will only print the pixel if the value for x & y are divisible by 2.
 * The value '3' only if they are both divisible by '3'. The bigger range you use for this, the longer the "fade" will
 * appear (hence it is called duration in functions like fade_in / fade_out.)
 *
 * @param display  - the lcd screen
 * @param digit  - the digit being printed
 * @param shift - shift value, see above description for details
